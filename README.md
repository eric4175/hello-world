# hello-world

Hi Peoples!!

I am Eric. I just start learning web development, and I am really interested in Javascript. 
I have a bachelor degree of EE, however I have found out that coding is where my passion actullay lies. I have some c/c++ coding experience but I am not an expert on any of them. I would like to have good time in this community and share my projects in the future.
